What is it?
-----------

WikipediaMiner is a toolkit for tapping the rich semantics encoded within Wikipedia.

It makes it easy to integrate Wikipedia's knowledge into your own applications, by:

* providing simplified, object-oriented access to Wikipedia's structure and content.
* measuring how terms and concepts in Wikipedia are connected to each other.
* detecting and disambiguating Wikipedia topics when they are mentioned in documents.
